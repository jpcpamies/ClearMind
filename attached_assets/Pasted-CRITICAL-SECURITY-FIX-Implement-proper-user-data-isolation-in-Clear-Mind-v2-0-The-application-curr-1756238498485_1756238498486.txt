CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Implement proper user data isolation in Clear Mind v2.0

The application currently shows the same data to all users regardless of who is logged in. This is a critical security issue that must be fixed immediately.

BACKEND API SECURITY UPDATES:

Update ALL database queries to filter by authenticated user:

1. In /server/routes/containers.js (or wherever container routes are):
   - GET /api/containers - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id
   - POST /api/containers - Include user_id in INSERT
   - PUT /api/containers/:id - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id AND id = :id
   - DELETE /api/containers/:id - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id AND id = :id

2. In /server/routes/ideas.js (or wherever idea routes are):
   - GET /api/ideas - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id
   - POST /api/ideas - Include user_id in INSERT
   - PUT /api/ideas/:id - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id AND id = :id
   - DELETE /api/ideas/:id - Add WHERE user_id = req.user.id AND id = :id

3. In staging table queries:
   - ideas_staging_canvas - Filter by user_id = req.user.id
   - ideas_staging_todolist - Filter by user_id = req.user.id

4. In sections table queries:
   - GET sections - Filter by user_id = req.user.id
   - All CRUD operations must include user_id filter

AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE VERIFICATION:
Ensure /server/middleware/auth.js properly:
- Extracts user ID from JWT token
- Queries database to get full user object
- Attaches user object to req.user with correct ID field
- Returns 401 if user not found in database

DATABASE QUERY EXAMPLES:
Instead of:
```sql
SELECT * FROM idea_containers;
Use:
sqlSELECT * FROM idea_containers WHERE user_id = $1;
Instead of:
sqlINSERT INTO ideas (title, description, container_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3);
Use:
sqlINSERT INTO ideas (title, description, container_id, user_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4);
FOREIGN KEY VALIDATION:
When user tries to access/modify resources, verify ownership:

When updating an idea, check the idea belongs to the user
When adding idea to container, check container belongs to the user
When accessing staging data, verify user owns the original resource

ERROR HANDLING:

Return 404 (not 403) when user tries to access non-existent or unauthorized resources
Never reveal whether a resource exists if user doesn't own it
Log security violations for monitoring

SAMPLE DATA UPDATE:
Update any existing sample data to ensure:

All records have proper user_id associations
Test users have separate, isolated datasets
No orphaned records without user associations

TESTING VERIFICATION:
Create at least 2 test users with different data:

User A: containers/ideas set A
User B: containers/ideas set B
Verify User A cannot see User B's data and vice versa
Test that API endpoints properly filter by authenticated user

This fix is CRITICAL for data privacy and security. Every database operation must be user-scoped.

‚úÖ **Validation**:
- Create two different user accounts
- Login with User A - should only see User A's data
- Logout and login with User B - should only see User B's data (completely different)
- Verify User A cannot access User B's containers/ideas via direct API calls
- Check that new data created by each user is properly isolated

üîÑ **NEXT STEPS**:
**Current Status**: Phase 2.5 - Critical Security Fix
**Next**: Phase 3 - Static UI Components (once data isolation is confirmed working)

Let me know:
‚úÖ If user data isolation works perfectly - each user sees only their own data
üîß If there are still data leakage issues
‚ùå If there were implementation problems

This security fix is mandatory before proceeding to any UI development!
