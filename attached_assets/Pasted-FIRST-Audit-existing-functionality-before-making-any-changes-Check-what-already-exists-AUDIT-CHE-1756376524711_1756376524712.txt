FIRST: Audit existing functionality before making any changes. Check what already exists:

AUDIT CHECKLIST - Report status of each item:
- Does category context menu (right-click) already exist? What options does it have?
- Are there any "Convert" or "Sync" buttons already in TodoList modals?
- What database tables currently exist for ideas, categories, todolists, tasks?
- Are there any existing relationships between ideas and tasks in the database?
- Do TodoList cards show any sync indicators or task counts currently?

AFTER AUDIT: Only implement missing functionality from the requirements below.

CANVAS TO TODOLIST CONVERSION (only if not exists):
- Add "Convert to Tasks" button in category context menu (right-click on category in sidebar)
- When clicked, show modal: "Convert [Category Name] ideas to TodoList"
- Modal shows: list of ideas in category, TodoList name input, section organization options
- Create TodoList with all ideas converted to tasks, maintaining title/description
- Original ideas remain on canvas (no deletion), but get "converted" flag in database

TODOLIST TO CANVAS SYNC (only if not exists):
- Add "Sync to Canvas" button in TodoList modal header
- When tasks are added/edited in TodoList, offer to create corresponding ideas on canvas
- New canvas ideas get positioned in category group area
- Maintain bidirectional relationship: idea â†” task linking in database

TASK MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS (only add missing features):
- Task priorities: Critical (red), High (orange), Medium (yellow), Low (green)
- Task status: Pending, In Progress, Completed
- Due dates for tasks (optional)
- Task descriptions (from original idea description)
- Section organization within TodoLists

VISUAL INDICATORS (only if not exists):
- Canvas ideas that have corresponding tasks show small TodoList icon
- TodoList tasks that have corresponding canvas ideas show small canvas icon
- Color consistency: category colors match across canvas and TodoLists
- Status indicators: completed tasks show strikethrough

DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS (extend existing schema only):
- Check if idea_task_relationships table exists, if not create it: idea_id, task_id, sync_status
- Track conversion status and last sync timestamps
- Maintain referential integrity between ideas and tasks
- Handle cascade updates when ideas or tasks are modified

SYNC CONFLICT HANDLING (only if not exists):
- Detect when idea and corresponding task have different titles/descriptions
- Show sync status indicators: "Synced", "Needs Update", "Conflicted"
- Simple conflict resolution: "Use Canvas Version" or "Use TodoList Version"
- Log sync history for debugging

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. First, show me audit results of what currently exists
2. Then implement only the missing pieces
3. Preserve all existing functionality exactly as it works now
4. Test each new feature individually before adding the next

CRITICAL: Do not modify, remove, or break any existing canvas drag & drop, category systems, TodoList functionality, or database relationships that already work.
