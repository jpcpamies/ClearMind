Fix and enhance TodoList creation functionality - DO NOT modify existing TodoList modal or category systems:

CREATE TODOLIST BUTTON:
- Change "Crear cuaderno" text to "Create TodoList"
- Button should open "Create New TodoList" modal when clicked
- Modal should allow creating TodoList from scratch OR from existing category

CREATE TODOLIST MODAL:
- Title: "Create New TodoList"
- TodoList name input field (required)
- Category selection dropdown (shows existing categories with color dots)
- Option: "Create empty TodoList" OR "Import ideas from selected category"
- If importing from category: show preview of how many ideas will be converted to tasks
- Create button (disabled until name is entered)

TODOLIST CREATION LOGIC:
- Create new TodoList record in database with: name, category_id, user_id, created_at
- If "Import ideas from category" selected:
  - Convert all ideas from selected category into tasks in new TodoList
  - Tasks inherit: title from idea.title, description from idea.description
  - Set default priority as "Medium" for imported tasks
  - Create "General Tasks" section by default for imported tasks

DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS:
- TodoList belongs to category (foreign key: category_id)
- Tasks belong to TodoList (foreign key: todolist_id)
- Maintain existing idea-category relationships (don't delete original ideas)
- Original ideas in canvas should remain unchanged after TodoList creation

TODOLIST GRID UPDATE:
- After successful creation, close modal and refresh TodoList grid
- New TodoList should appear immediately in grid with correct task count
- Show success message: "TodoList '[name]' created successfully"
- Grid card should show: category color dot, TodoList name, task count, "No tasks yet" or task summary

ERROR HANDLING:
- Validate TodoList name (minimum 2 characters, maximum 100 characters)
- Handle duplicate names gracefully
- Show error messages for failed creation
- Don't close modal if creation fails

DO NOT CHANGE: Existing TodoList modal functionality, task management, export features, or any working category systems.

ONLY IMPLEMENT: Create TodoList modal, database operations, and grid refresh functionality.
