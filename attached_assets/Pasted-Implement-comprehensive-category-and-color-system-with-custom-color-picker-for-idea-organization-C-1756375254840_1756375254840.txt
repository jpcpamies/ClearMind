Implement comprehensive category and color system with custom color picker for idea organization:

CATEGORY SYSTEM:
- Extend existing database to support categories with colors
- Each idea can be assigned to one category (relationship: idea -> category)
- Categories have: name, color (hex), creation date, user ownership
- Default categories on new user: "General" (#6366f1), "Work" (#10b981), "Personal" (#f59e0b)

VISUAL GROUPING ON CANVAS:
- Ideas display category color as left border (4px thick colored bar)
- Group ideas visually by category with subtle background regions
- Add category name labels that appear when hovering over grouped areas
- Cards of same category should have visual connection/grouping effect

CATEGORY MANAGEMENT IN SIDEBAR:
- Replace current "IDEA GROUPS" section with "CATEGORIES" 
- Show each category with: colored dot, name, idea count
- Add + button to create new categories with color selection
- Category context menu (right-click): Edit name, Change color, Delete category
- When deleting category, move ideas to "General" category

CUSTOM COLOR PICKER SYSTEM:
- In category creation/edit modal, show predefined palette first: 8 color swatches
- Add "Custom Color" button that opens color picker wheel
- Use HTML5 color input type="color" or implement react-color library if available
- Color picker features: color wheel, hex input field, RGB values display
- Show live preview of selected color on category dot while picking
- Include color preview with category name to show final result

COLOR PICKER UI:
- Modal layout: predefined colors grid (2x4) at top, custom picker below
- Selected color shows active state (border highlight)
- Custom color section: color wheel + hex input + RGB values
- Live preview updates category dot in real-time as user picks color
- "Save" and "Cancel" buttons for color selection confirmation

DATABASE PERSISTENCE:
- Ensure categories table stores hex color values correctly (VARCHAR(7) for #RRGGBB)
- Update category color immediately in database when saved
- All UI elements reflect new color instantly after database update
- Validate hex color format before saving to database

IDEA ASSIGNMENT:
- In "New Idea" modal, add category dropdown selector
- In edit idea modal, add category change option  
- Show selected category with color preview in modals
- Allow bulk category assignment for selected ideas
- Default new ideas to "General" category if none selected

COLOR SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:
- Predefined palette: #6366f1, #10b981, #f59e0b, #ef4444, #8b5cf6, #06b6d4, #f97316, #84cc16
- Custom colors: any valid hex color from color picker
- Ensure colors have good contrast for accessibility (test against white backgrounds)
- Color consistency across: sidebar dots, card borders, labels, modal previews

UPDATE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY:
- Maintain all current drag & drop, zoom, positioning features
- Categories should not affect existing canvas behavior
- Ideas without category default to "General"
- All existing modals and UI should continue working exactly as before
